Idea I:
Training restaurant chefs via a VR cooking simulation.

three key features:
-User
	-players need to cook with at least one arm

-Scenario
	-players need to multitask (e.g. be able to do other tasks around the kitchen in addition to cooking such as washing the dishes, mopping the floors, catering the guests)

-Backend
	-We may have multiple chefs in the kitchen doing productive work

novel idea:
-we can reverse time when let's say, something is overcooked as a way to forgive mistakes

-we can also have an anti-gravity feature to prevent dropping fragile objects on the floor and spilling food and drinks

required resources:
-hardware
	-any vr headset that works in unity will do
-personnel
	-at least one vr user
-asset
	-kitchen environment that is big enough to fit at least four players
	-food and beverages



Idea II:
Training military soldiers via a simulation room with Multiple targets they need focus on
