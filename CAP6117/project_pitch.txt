Idea I:
Training restaurant chefs via a VR cooking simulation.

three key features:
-User
	-players need to cook with both arms
	-players need to be able to cook a particular recipe within a particular time frame
-Scenario
	-players need to multitask (e.g. be able to do other tasks around the kitchen in addition to cooking such as washing the dishes, mopping the floors, catering the guests)

-Backend
	-We may have multiple chefs in the kitchen doing productive work
	-We need a database that stores the performance stats of each player

novel idea:
-we can reverse time when let's say, something is overcooked as a way to forgive mistakes
-we can also have an anti-gravity feature to prevent dropping fragile objects on the floor and spilling food and drinks

required resources:
-hardware
	-any vr headset that works in unity will do (e.g. oculus quest II)
-personnel
	-at least one vr user
-asset
	-kitchen environment that is big enough to fit at least four players
	-food and beverages
	-recipe book
-skills
	-players need to effectively follow instructions from the recipe cook book
	-players need to have attention to detail (e.g. performance will be based on how well the food was cooked, how fast it was cooked and how organized the overall kitchen is before and after the cooking)

Idea II:
Training military soldiers via a simulation room with Multiple targets they need focus on

three key features:
-backend
	-multiple players in the sim room with robots
-User
	-players will need to hold their pistol with one hand

	-players need to get ammo from the support player
